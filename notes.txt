"repo: self" refers to the same repository that contains the pipeline YAML — i.e., the current repo. 
By default Azure Pipelines automatically checks out that repository (checkout: self), so declaring it as a resource is usually redundant unless you need to:

treat the repo as an explicit resource (specify a different ref/branch)
use a different service connection/endpoint
fetch it when automatic checkout is disabled (checkout: none)

Examples:

explicit self checkout at a specific ref:

```yaml
# filepath: example.yml
resources:
  repositories:
  - repository: self
    ref: refs/heads/main
```

disable automatic checkout and checkout only what you want:

```yaml
# filepath: example.yml
steps:
- checkout: none

# later explicitly checkout self
- checkout: self
```

checkout another repo:

```yaml
# filepath: example.yml
resources:
  repositories:
  - repository: toolingRepo
    type: git
    name: Org/OtherRepo
    endpoint: myServiceConnection

steps:
- checkout: toolingRepo
```
